Explore the docs \u00bb Request Feature \u00b7 Report Bug \u00b7 \u2b50 Consider starring the repo! \u2b50 Notice: ngsderive is largely a forensic analysis tool useful in backwards computing information from next-generation sequencing data. Notably, most results are provided as a 'best guess' \u2014 the tool does not claim 100% accuracy and results should be considered with that understanding. An exception would be the junction-annotation tool which analyzes more concrete evidence than the other tools. \ud83c\udfa8 Features The following attributes can be guessed using ngsderive: Illumina Instrument. Infer which Illumina instrument was used to generate the data by matching against known instrument and flowcell naming patterns. Each guess comes with a confidence score. RNA-Seq Strandedness. Infer from the data whether RNA-Seq data was generated using a Stranded-Forward, Stranded-Reverse, or Unstranded protocol. Pre-trimmed Read Length. Compute the distribution of read lengths in the file and attempt to guess what the original read length of the experiment was. PHRED Score Encoding. Infers which encoding scheme was used to store PHRED scores as ASCII characters. Junction Annotation. Annotates splice junctions as novel, partial novel, or known in comparison to a reference gene model. \ud83d\udcda Getting Started Installation You can install ngsderive using the Python Package Index ( PyPI ). pip install ngsderive \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Development If you are interested in contributing to the code, please first review our CONTRIBUTING.md document.

PHRED scores are encoded as ASCII characters, but which ASCII characters encode for which relative quality scores depends on the build and generation of the sequencing machine used. The encoding subcommand detects PHRED+33 (AKA Illumina1.8+ or Sanger), Illumina1.3, and Illumina1.0 quality encoding formats. The BAM specification calls for PHRED+33 , however this is also the most permissive encoding. It is possible for a stricter encoding to be mis-translated as PHRED+33 and appear to be of higher quality than it is in truth. This is due to Illumina1.3 using ASCII characters that are a subset of those in Illumina 1.0, and Illumina 1.0 using a subset of characters in Sanger format (that is Illumina1.3 \u2282 Illumina1.0 and Illumina1.0 \u2282 Sanger). This subcommand can be used to check if base scores are suspiciously high throughout a BAM, and a mis-translation may have occurred. As a hypothetical example of a mis-translation; a FASTQ sequenced by an Illumina1.3 machine has PHRED quality scores ranging from 6-22. They would be encoded as ASCII values 70-86. If those ASCII values are not adjusted during BAM alignment, someone decoding the PHRED score according to the PHRED+33 specification would think the quality range for that sample was 37-53. This is erroneously high, and may convey undue confidence in the quality of the BAM. ngsderive 's encoding check implementation is based on details of the encoding schemes described [here][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format#Encoding]. Limitations All 3 possible encodings have the same upper range, and only differ in terms of lower quality scores. Thus if the provided read data is all of high quality, it may be classified as a stricter encoding than was originally used to generate the data. If the downstream use of this value is needed to ensure all PHRED scores are within the derived encoding, use --n-samples -1 to parse the entire file.","title":"encoding"},{"location":"subcommands/encoding/#encoding","text":"The encoding subcommand detects the likely PHRED score encoding schema used for FASTQ and BAM files.

Note that due to the need to (1) examine the alignment status of a read [not included in FASTQ] and (2) fetch regions using random access [not available with SAM files], only BAM files are currently supported for this subcommand. Strandedness can estimated by observing the following characteristics of a particular read: Whether the read is read 1 or read 2 (\"read ordinal\"). Whether the read was aligned to the + or - strand (\"read strand\") Given a gene model, whether a feature of interest (usually a gene) falls on the + or - strand (\"gene strand\"). A shorthand notation for the state of a read can be achieved by simply concatenating the three characteristics above (e.g., 1+- means that a read 1 was aligned to the positive strand and a gene was observed at the same location on the negative strand). Given the notation above, the following lookup table can be used to see whether a read is evidence for forward-strandedness or reverse-strandedness: Patterns Evidence for strandedness type 1++ , 1-- , 2+- , 2-+ Forward 2++ , 2-- , 1+- , 1-+ Reverse Any valid GTF or GFF file should be compatible with ngsderive . The strandedness check requires random access of the gene model, which means the file must be sorted and tabixed. If you supply an unsorted or untabixed GTF/GFF, we will create one for you using the supplied file. If you encounter any errors related to your gene model choice, please let us know using GitHub Issues . Algorithm At the time of writing, the algorithm works roughly like this: The gene model is read in and only gene features are retained. For --n-genes times, a randomly sampled gene is selected from the gene model. The gene must pass a quality check. Of particular interest, The gene must not be an overlapping feature on the opposite strand which would present ambiguous results. Optionally , the gene must be a protein coding gene. This defaults to True . Optionally , the gene must have at least --minimum-reads-per-gene minimum reads per gene. This defaults to 10 reads. All of the reads from that region of the genome are extracted and put through several quality filters including but not limited to: The read must not be marked as QC-failed. The read must not be marked as a duplicate. The read must not be marked as secondary. The read must not be unmapped. Optionally , the read have a minimum MAPQ score. This defaults to a MAPQ score of 30. For all reads that pass the above filters, compute the evidence and tally results. This lookup table is used for the classification of strandedness based on the evidence: Lookup Value 40% <= forward_reads_pct <= 60% Unstranded 80% <= forward_reads_pct Stranded-Forward 80% <= reverse_reads_pct Stranded-Reverse Else Inconclusive The tool will repeat the strandedness test at most --max-tries times to try to find a non- Inconclusive prediction. Differences The most popular strandedness inference tool that the author is aware of is RSeQC's infer_experiment.py . The main difference is that RSeQC starts at the beginning of the BAM file and takes the first n reads that match its criteria. If the BAM is coordinate sorted, this would mean its not uncommon to have all of the evidence at the beginning of chr1 . Anecdotally, this method differs in that it is slightly slower than infer_experiment.py but is expected to be more robust to biases caused by which reads are sampled. Further, reads within RSeQC may fall into ambiguous regions for which a read is not decisively evidence for a particular strandedness. These cases are eliminated by the use of (a) filtering to only coding regions and (b) removal of any regions of the gene model for which genes overlap on each strand. Limitations Does not yet work with single-end data (simply because the author doesn't have any on hand). The tool will throw an error if any unpaired reads are discovered (let us know in the issues if you need this supported). Though hundreds of Unstranded and Stranded-Reverse data has been tested and verified, Stranded-Forward data has not been tested to work with this tool (simply because the author doesn't have on hand).
